Here we use the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and its enhancement called Limited Boltzmann Machine (LBM) on a quantum computer to model the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth data for a MoS2 monolayer. The CVD data for Boltzmann machines are generated by reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations. The Boltzmann machines give insight into the semiconducting (2H) and metallic (1T) phases and defects generated during the CVD growth of MoS2. We compare the performances of the two types of Boltzmann machine models, i.e. RBM versus augmented topologies with limited intra-layer coupling between the hidden units (LBM). We show that limited topologies have a performance advantage over restricted topologies. We examine connectivity within our topological variants, explore hardware qubit mapping schemes, and discuss what performance differences may imply about locality within the data without prior knowledge.","tags":null,"title":"Boltzmann machine modeling of layered MoS2 synthesis on a quantum annealer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Krishnaraj P M","Ankith Mohan","Srinivasa K G"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535155200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535155200,"objectID":"055df6712b44e0097526b67147e5a8b2","permalink":"https://ankithmo.github.io/publication/pm-2018-practical/","publishdate":"2018-08-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pm-2018-practical/","section":"publication","summary":"Although there are innumerable complex systems and therefore a large number of networks, the focus of this book is social networks. A social network contains individuals as nodes and links representing the relationship between these individuals. The study of social networks is of particular interest because it focuses on this abstract view of human relationships which gives insight into various kinds of social relationships ranging all the way from bargaining power to psychological health. We descibe in detail graph theory, statistical properties and graph algorithms. Through this, we hope to describe the various patterns and statistical properties of networks, introduce design principles and models for looking at these properties, provide an understanding as to why networks are organized the way they are and apply our understanding to predict behaviour of networks.","tags":null,"title":"Practical Social Network Analysis with Python","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Krishnaraj P M","Ankith Mohan","Srinivasa K G"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1500249600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1500249600,"objectID":"b214eddd8a90796989fd44aacc4091ad","permalink":"https://ankithmo.github.io/publication/krishnaraj-2017-performance/","publishdate":"2017-07-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/krishnaraj-2017-performance/","section":"publication","summary":"Identification of influential nodes in a social network is an interesting problem since these nodes assist in faster information propagation in the network.
